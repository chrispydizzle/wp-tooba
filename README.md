Wordpress theme I did for a sort of charitable enterprise I'm working wiht.

Borrowed heavily from these guys: 

Contributors: Rustaurius, EtoileWebDesign
Donate Link: http://www.etoilewebdesign.com/plugin-donations/

Their work was instrumental in giving me a catalog-esque foundation for what I needed to do here. 

I also took (take) advantage of revslider so don't hate me.

Also this super-cool lightbox js framework that let me quickly display a professional looking image gallery with pretty much zero effort.

So, kudos to you Lokesh https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/

This is obviously just the theme, more to come in the near future.
