Wordpress theme I did for a sort of charitable enterprise I'm working with.

Borrowed heavily from these guys:

Actually I'm lying I basically just tweaked their code a bit to do what I needed it. So thanks guys!

I also took (take) advantage of revslider so don't hate me.

Also this super-cool lightbox js framework that let me quickly display a professional looking image gallery with pretty much zero effort.

So, kudos to you Lokesh https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/

This is obviously just the theme, more to come in the near future.
